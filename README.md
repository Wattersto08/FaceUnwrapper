# FaceUnwrapper

This was a silly attempt at something i saw on the internet,

A lunchtime project, using open cv this program takes linear slices frame by frame of a video and stitches them together. the "Unwrapped Face" file has was the result of a spinning chair and some laugh's - go forth and play!
